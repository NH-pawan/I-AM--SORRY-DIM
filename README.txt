For_Yeobo — Night-Sky Apology Page (PWA + Chat-style)

Files included:
- index.html       -> Main night-sky apology page (mobile-first)
- chat.html        -> WhatsApp-style chat scene
- styles.css       -> Shared styles
- manifest.json    -> PWA manifest
- sw.js            -> Service worker (basic caching)
- icons/           -> app icons (svg saved as .png)

How to use:
1) Unzip the folder and open index.html on your phone or PC.
2) To install as PWA: open index.html in Chrome on Android, then tap the browser menu > Add to Home screen (or use the Install button if prompt appears).
3) To share the chat: open chat.html and use the share/copy features manually.

Notes:
- The bundle is offline-capable via the included service worker (basic cache).
- If icons don't show due to file:// restrictions, host the folder on a simple static host (GitHub Pages, Netlify) or use a local server.
- You can edit message lines directly inside the HTML before sending if you want to personalize.

Made for Pawan (Beast). Rose accent, Night-Sky theme.
